# Cleanup Organization

With the new efforts that are starting, we want to provide a good ecosystem for all.
For that, we need to clean and decide which repositories needs to be deleted, archived or which one need to be stopped.

If we choose to archive to packages, they need to be deprecated on npmjs.org aswell.
